            <p class="about-text">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                I've made a big jump over to the bootcamp to get expert reviews of my solo projects and 
                meet like minded peers like me.

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a life long learner. 
                    I used to spend hours and hours learning, then trying to create simple projects
                using what i learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what i was learning
                    and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
            </div>
            
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about
                    what i was learning and after each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect 
                    on what i learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grow what I was learning, and i realized that posting my learning
                    summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
